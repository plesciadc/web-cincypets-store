                  <p>Our company consists of many teams, that’s why you must be a team player and excellent communicator both in writing and oral speech. Our work is also based on mutual assistance, so be ready to lend a helping hand whenever you’re asked.</p>
                  <p>You are unlikely to find a project manager who wouldn’t appreciate punctuality and discipline. The same goes for PMs of Intense. If you want to build a long-term career at our company, you will have to avoid late arrivals, unnecessary breaks and hanging out in social networks. Also be polite not only with your boss, but also with colleagues and newcomers.</p>
